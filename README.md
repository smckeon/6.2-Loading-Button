## 6.2 Loading Button
Using a Backbone collection, I built a loading button. The loading button fetches a collection when clicked, becomes disabled when clicked on/changes its text to "Loading...", and then returns to its normal state after the collection is finished being fetched.

### The fetch is quick so you have to pay attention to the button text!
